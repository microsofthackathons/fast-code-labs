<p>
  In this codelab we first created a basic component, with hardly any styling and
  functionality. After that we created a more specific card based on the basic
  element. For all kind of use cases different components could be made based on the
  basic element, or even extensions of an extended-card.
</p>

<p>
  We can have very simple, small, basic components which have only all basic functions
  covered. Every custom desire can be an extension of the basic element. Not only
  styling or properties can be added, but basically everything can be added.

<h2>Extra assignment</h2>
<p>
  Go to <a href="https://ing.nl">ing.nl</a>, <a href="https://ing.be">ing.be</a> and
  <a href="https://ing.de">ing.de</a> and take a look at all different types cards.
  Each page already exists out of different type of cards. Some are having differ more
  than other, but in general they all have the same basis.
</p>
<p>
  Try to create two, three or four extensions of the <code>simple-card</code> or some
  more extended card. Which can match these different cards.
