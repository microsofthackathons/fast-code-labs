<h2><strong>Simple card component</strong></h2>

<p>
  For our next exercise we start with creating a small very basic component that can be the basis of several
  end-customer components. When we have created this basic component we are going to extend it.

  The basic component we are going to create is a card-component. It is commonly used on websites as a small panel with
  a summary of another page and a link to that page. It often has a header and an image.
